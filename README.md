# C-Python-Compiler
This C++ program receives a .py file and outputs the results. It can evaluate expressions, create local and global variables, use if/else logic and create functions, and print to console. The only variable type it admits are integer numbers.

## To run:
-Open file in terminal
-Run the following code:
  -G++ mypython.cpp -o mypython
  -./mypython <name of python file>
-Use the testcases on this repository (example: in01.py) or build your own testcases.
